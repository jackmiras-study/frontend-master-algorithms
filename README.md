# Algorithms and Data Structures in PHP

This repository contains the implementation of various algorithms and data structures inspired by the [FrontendMaster Algorithms](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) Course, using vanilla PHP.

## Getting Started

To run and test the algorithms and data structures in this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- PHP should be installed on your system.
- Composer is required to manage the project's dependencies.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:jackmiras-study/frontend-master-algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend-master-algorithms
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

### Running the Tests

To execute the tests for the implemented algorithms and data structures, use the following command:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest
```

This will run the test suite using Pest, a minimal testing framework for PHP.
